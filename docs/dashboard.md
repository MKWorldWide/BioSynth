# Dashboard

The analytics dashboard visualizes core biosynthetic metrics. This example uses a line chart from Recharts, but in production you can integrate any data source that aligns with the Solar Khan covenant.

## Development Notes

- Dashboard lives at `/dashboard`.
- Replace static demo data with secured API calls.
- Ensure authentication and rate limiting on any data endpoints.
