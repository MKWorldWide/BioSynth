### Updated
- README structure and content
- License information
- Code of conduct

## Development Workflow

### Changes
- Enabled TypeScript strict mode
- Added pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Standardized code formatting
- Improved error handling and type safety
- Added automated testing infrastructure

## Breaking Changes

- None. The changes are backward compatible with existing code.

## Known Issues

- Some TypeScript errors may need to be addressed in the codebase
- Test coverage needs to be improved
- Some components may need refactoring to follow the new patterns

## Next Steps

1. Address TypeScript errors in the codebase
2. Add more unit and integration tests
3. Set up end-to-end testing
4. Implement CI/CD for production deployments
5. Monitor application performance and optimize as needed
